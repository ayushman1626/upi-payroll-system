This document outlines the core registration and onboarding flow for the UPI-based salary disbursement system.

## 1. Admin / HR Registration Flow

- Admin (responsible person from the organization) registers using:
    - Email
    - Password
- System sends a verification email (OTP or link)
- After verifying email:
    - User becomes active
    - System prompts them to complete company details

---

## 2. Company Profile Setup

Admin adds:
- Company Name
- GST Number
- Company Type
- Registered Company Email
- PAN (optional)
- Contact Number
- Address (optional)

The company entity is now created and associated with the admin user as its owner.

## 3. Adding Employees (Invitation Flow)

Admin (or HR) adds employees with:
- Name
- Email ID
- (Optional) Salary / Department / Designation

System does:
- Creates a temporary EmployeeInvite entry
- Sends email invite to the employee with a secure registration link or token

---

## 4. Employee Registration (Self-Onboarding)

Employee receives invite email and registers:
- Sets password
- Adds phone number
- Provides UPI ID

System performs:
- UPI ID verification (to ensure UPI name matches employee name)
- Email verification (if not already done)

If all successful:
- Creates User entry with role = EMPLOYEE
- Links user to Company and creates EmployeeProfile
- Marks invite status as accepted
